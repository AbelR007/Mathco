As "MathCo", the name itself means, "Maths Companion", a guide to help you out for whatever operation do you need it.
We're at a constant rate of combining all mathematical operations in one module for ease of access and performance.
We want to keep libraries simpler and easier to use. 

## Examples
- Simple Usage of Mathco Library
```python
from mathco import Basic
x = Basic() # Creates an instance
print(x.add(1,2)) # Gives out output as "3"

1. Basic()
   - `x.add(x,y)` : Adds two integers
   - `x.sub(x,y)` : Subtracts two integers
   - `x.mul(x,y)` : Multiply two integers
   - `x.div(x,y)` : Divides two integers
2. Fibonacci()
   - `x.series(n)`: Fibonacci Series ranging to "n"
